# Console — development context

The **console** is the in-cluster post-install operator UI for the ARTESCA+ VSS stack. Next.js 16, port **:8800**, runs as a K8s pod in namespace `console` (manifests at [`k8s/`](k8s/)). Distinct from [`isv-labs:deployer/`](isv-labs:deployer/) on :5002, which is laptop-side pre-install provisioning — the console assumes the cluster is up and running.

> **`isv-labs:` paths** point into Scality's internal lab repository, which holds the deployer, the VSS workload manifests and the lab tooling. The console was extracted from it and is deployed onto the stack it provisions.
>
> ⚠ **This file is public and that repository is not going to be.** So a path written that way is not a link and never will be — it is a note about where a Scality-internal piece lives, kept only where it explains why code here is shaped the way it is. Two rules follow: **do not add new ones**, and when a fact a reader needs happens to live over there, **write the fact down here** instead of pointing at it. Everything needed to build, run, deploy and validate the console is in this repository. (Separately, `isv-labs.cameras.v2` and friends are frozen config-schema identifiers, not paths — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-isv-labs-schema-strings).)

## Working with Claude Code: the main session orchestrates, subagents do the work

Keep the session the human types in lean. It holds requests, decisions and short
conclusions; reading, searching, implementing, testing and reviewing happen in
subagents (Agent tool), which return a summary rather than file dumps.

- **Delegate by default** whenever a task means reading several files, sweeping the
  codebase, implementing, running long gates, or reviewing. Work directly only for a
  single-fact lookup or a one-line edit where the file and change are already known.
- **Pick the model and the effort by task. The default is Opus at effort `medium`.**
  On Stéphane's laptop the agent types in `~/.claude/agents/` fix both — choose the
  type, not a `model`:
  - **`mechanic`** — Sonnet 5.5, effort `medium`: work whose target is already stated —
    searches, enumeration, edits the tests pin, running gates, doc updates.
  - **`researcher`** — Opus 5.5, effort `medium`: reading across repos and sources and
    writing findings with citations.
  - **`builder`** — Opus 5.5, effort `medium`: design, implementation, debugging,
    anything that moves a figure or classifies.
  - **`builder-high`** — Opus 5.5, effort `high`: a builder task that failed at medium.
  - **`verifier`** — Opus 5.5, effort `high`, no write tools: once per deliverable, at
    the end, never once per lane or per step — adversarial review, cross-checking
    drafts, security-sensitive or schema/production-affecting changes.
  - **No agent type runs on Fable, and `~/.claude/settings.json` excludes it**
    (`availableModels`) and caps effort at `high` (`maxEffortLevel`). Measured from
    local transcripts, 2026-10-08 to 10-18: `verifier` on Fable ran 5–8 passes per lane
    (1,495 calls on 10-15), and `builder` at `xhigh` was about 65% of estimated spend.
  - Raise effort only after a task has failed at medium, and judge cost per finished
    task, not per request.
- **A subagent does the work itself and never spawns another subagent.** Delegation is
  the orchestrating session's job; one level deep is the whole design. If a subagent
  judges the task needs a stronger model, it says so and stops — it does not launch
  one. Measured 2026-09-13: two Sonnet agents each spent roughly 100k tokens deciding
  to launch an Opus child and returned a plan instead of a result, so the cheap tier
  was billed for nothing, the expensive one ran anyway, and the grandchild was
  invisible to the orchestrator — no completion notification, and two of them writing
  into one shared worktree. Say it in the brief ("do this yourself, do not use the
  Agent tool"), because an agent handed a hard task reaches for that reflex on its own.
- **Brief each subagent fully** — it starts with no context: goal, paths, constraints,
  what "done" means, and what to report back. Ask for the conclusion and evidence, not
  transcripts. Run independent agents in parallel.
- **Relay only what matters** to the human: outcome, decisions needed, verification
  evidence. A subagent's "tests pass" is a claim until the evidence is seen.
- **Hand over at 200k context.** Every call re-reads the whole context, so cost grows
  with it. An orchestrating session whose calls pass 200k tokens writes a hand-over note
  (open items, decisions taken and pending, running agents, where each lives) and stops;
  the next session starts from that note. Measured 2026-10-18: a background orchestrator
  that never compacted reached 420k per call, median 269k.

## Be concise and specific in everything you write for me

Applies to every output a human reads — session replies, summaries of work done,
emails, Jira tickets, Confluence and Drive docs, meeting agendas and notes, Slack
messages, commit messages, PR descriptions, status reports. Subagents report under
this rule too, and the orchestrating session re-applies it before relaying anything.

- **Answer first, then stop.** No preamble, no restating the request back, no closing
  offer of further help. If the answer is one sentence, write one sentence.
- **Be specific, not general.** Name the file, the ticket key, the number, the command,
  the date. "Fixed the tests" is not a report; "the 3 failing cases in
  `gate-coverage.test.ts` pass, full suite green after the last edit" is.
- **Label every claim: verified, asserted, or unknown.** Say which, and say what the
  evidence was. Never round an unverified thing up to a fact.
- **Report the outcome, not the process.** No narration of the steps taken, unless the
  steps *are* the deliverable. No account of what was tried and abandoned.
- **Bullets over paragraphs, one idea per bullet.** Cut adjectives, hedges, filler
  openers, and transition language ("previously", "now unified", "as mentioned above").
- **A number without its source is noise.** Give the source or drop the number.
- **Say what is missing.** "Blocked — CI has not run since the last commit" is a
  complete report. Padding around a gap is not.

**This block is replicated verbatim** in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and in the checked-in
`CLAUDE.md` of every repo Stéphane owns, so teammates' sessions follow it too. Edit
one, edit all.

## AI-assisted output (Charles Prost, eng-all, 2026-09-23)

- **No AI attribution in commits or PRs.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` footer in commit
  messages, no "Generated with Claude Code" line in PR descriptions — this overrides the
  harness's default attribution reminder. The Product/Eng Anthropic team plan enforces the
  same through managed settings; this block keeps sessions from re-adding the lines by hand.
  Your name on a commit means you stand behind it.
- **Communication is between humans.** Claude may draft a ticket, PR description, email or
  comment, but it ships only when the message and intent are clear on first read — never a
  raw Claude artifact, never prose that leaves the reader to do the understanding the author
  skipped. You own what you send in your name.

## Page tree

23 pages (22 in the nav plus `/cameras/bindings`), all server components by default; client components are scoped to interactive bits (forms, auto-refresh). The sidebar ([`Nav.tsx`](src/components/Nav.tsx)) groups them into four labeled sections — **Live** (Overview / Topology / Incidents / Cameras), **AI & Storage** (Search / Ask the Store / VSS Chat / Evidence / Storage / KV Cache), **Configure** (Scenarios / VLM Prompt / Tuning / Agent / Test Footage / Profiles), **System** (Secrets / Logs / Diagnostics / Sizing Studio / Settings / About); section headers are hidden in kiosk mode. Below the groups sits an external **AI Factory** link (`AI_FACTORY_URL`), rendered outside `NAV_GROUPS` on purpose: the ISV-ARCH-05 generator parses `NAV_GROUPS` as the page list, and the AI Factory is a separate app.

The pages: `/`, `/topology`, `/incidents`, `/chat`, `/search`, `/storage`, `/kvcache`, `/analytics`, `/evidence`, `/agent`, `/cameras`, `/cameras/bindings`, `/scenarios`, `/prompt`, `/tuning`, `/test-footage`, `/profiles`, `/secrets`, `/logs`, `/diagnostics`, `/sizing-studio`, `/settings`, `/about`.

What each one does, and the traps in a few of them: [`docs/pages.md`](docs/pages.md).

## Cluster references — single source of truth

[`src/lib/cluster-refs.ts`](src/lib/cluster-refs.ts) is the **canonical** lookup for every K8s service name, ConfigMap name, Deployment name, env-var key, and topic name the console addresses. Every value reads from `process.env` first so operators can override via [`k8s/console/11-configmap-env.yaml`](k8s/11-configmap-env.yaml) at deploy time without rebuilding the image. Defaults target the VSS Helm-chart layout — the `vss-<profile>` namespace (default `vss-base`, via `VSS_NAMESPACE`) and the chart's service names (`vss-vios-sensor`, `vss-vios-streamprocessing`, `vss-rtvi-vlm`, `vss-agent`, …); set `CONSOLE_LEGACY_NAMESPACES=1` to address the pre-Helm raw-manifest namespaces (`vst`/`rtvi`/`nvidia-vss-single-gpu`/`alerts`) on fixture instances. The `cameras` ConfigMap and the register-cameras Jobs live outside the release, in `CAMERAS_NAMESPACE` (default `pyramid-ingress`, the lab's name) — `CLUSTER.cameras.namespace`, `watchedNamespaces()` and the `/api/settings/rbac` summary all read it. RBAC is in [`k8s/01-rbac.yaml`](k8s/01-rbac.yaml) (read-only, cluster-wide) plus two per-namespace Roles the deployer generates from the resolved namespace list — `console-writer` for the config writes and `console-exec` for `pods/exec` in the VSS namespace only. [`k8s/02-workload-rbac.yaml.example`](k8s/02-workload-rbac.yaml.example) is the same content with the namespace left a placeholder, and is a **parallel implementation** of what `deploy-console.sh` emits inline: a verb in one and not the other means a hand deploy 403s where a scripted one succeeds.

⚠ **Auditing `pods/exec` needs `kubectl auth can-i create pods --subresource=exec`.** The `pods/exec` spelling silently answers about `pods` — measured on kubectl 1.33 against a role granting `get,create`, it reports `create` **denied** and `list` **allowed**, wrong both ways and indistinguishable from an authoritative answer. Reading the live rules and comparing (`kubectl get clusterrole console-reader -o json`) is what catches it. Nothing needs exec outside the VSS namespace: `df` on the VST cache, `pg_isready` + two `psql` counts, and `redis-cli ping`/`info`. GPU state comes from Prometheus, and the `/diagnostics` nvidia-smi test runs over SSH.

Architecture note that drove the design: all RTVI / VST / alerts / test-footage pods run `hostNetwork: true` on a single MetalK8s node. Service DNS works for the console (which does **not** use hostNetwork), but the pods address each other via the bare node IP (10.42.1.111). The console always uses ClusterIP / headless-service DNS — the values in `cluster-refs.ts` reflect that, not the in-cluster bare-IP shortcuts.

The exported `CLUSTER` object covers: kafka brokers + topic names, redis URL, VST endpoints (sensor list / sensor add / proxy stream add / `sensorBase` + `storageBase` for clip download / `mediaOrigin` — the origin the `/api/media` proxy forwards snapshot/clip paths onto), mediamtx API, prometheus, grafana (url + user + password + login hint), alert-worker, agent (chat base URL / `mediaHost` — the host:port prefix the agent stamps into snapshot/clip URLs, rewritten to `/api/media` / `configMap` + `configKey` — the ConfigMap + key backing the `/agent` editor), `mediaProxyEnabled` (gates the `/api/media` proxy and the chat media-URL rewrite), RTVI ConfigMap keys, NIM preview endpoint, scenarios CM, alerts tuning CM, cameras CM + register-job prefix, S3 bucket + endpoint, the KV-cache vLLM's Deployment (`kvcache.vllmNamespace`/`vllmDeployment`), the AI Factory's GPU-mode record and UI link (`aiFactory`), restartable component map.

**Incident clip playback.** `/api/clips/[sensor]/[ts]` (and the `/preload` warmer) serve an HLS clip per incident. Incidents carry the sensor *name*, but the VST clip-download API is keyed by stream id — so the route resolves name → active stream id via `sensor/list` (preferring the `online` sensor with a recorded timeline), downloads the ±5s MP4 from `GET /storage/file/{streamId}?startTime&endTime&container=mp4` on the VST storage base (`vss-vios-ingress:30888/vst/api/v1`; override `VST_STORAGE_URL`), then transcodes MP4→HLS onto the PVC cache. Shared helpers: [`src/lib/streams/vst-clip.ts`](src/lib/streams/vst-clip.ts). A window at a still-recording timeline edge can 404 until that segment finalizes; older incidents always play.

**Camera recording + the Restart action.** A camera records only after **both** VST registration steps run — `sensor/add` (with a required `username`, empty string valid; a camera's optional label maps to VST's `location` field — VST's `/sensor/add` has **no** `description` field and silently drops unknown keys, so [`vstAddSensor`](src/lib/helpers/vst.ts) sets `location`) **then** `proxy/stream/add` (`vstStartStream`). A sensor registered with only step 1 comes up `online` but never records, and the `REC` badge (`isTimelinePresent`) can read stale-true while nothing is being written — so "is it recording" is only truthfully answered by a 200 from `GET /api/clips/<name>/<isoTs>`, not the badge. The `/cameras` **Restart** button ([`src/app/api/cameras/[id]/restart/route.ts`](src/app/api/cameras/[id]/restart/route.ts)) re-runs both steps, resolving the RTSP URL from the config store → GCS camera doc → live VST (never constructed from `CAMERA_SIM_HOST`), and deletes the old VST sensor by its UUID `sensorId`. The same two-step add lives in the reconcile adapter, so `/cameras` add / restore / reconcile all record. A streamprocessing rollout does **not** restore recording (it rebuilds proxies, not recorder pipelines). Camera management (add/delete/restart) treats the camera-sim control-plane as a best-effort side-effect, not a gate — a camera defined by its RTSP URL (real IP camera or sim stream) is handled identically.

**mediamtx API auth.** [`helpers/mediamtx.ts`](src/lib/helpers/mediamtx.ts) sends basic auth (user `camsim`, password `CAMSIM_PASS` from the `console-auth` Secret); unset → a "credentials missing" warning and no request, never an empty list passed off as data. The VM's `:9997` is admin-range (IAP) only on GCP, so a pod cannot reach it unless the VM was launched with the box's egress as admin source — README "Camera-sim API credentials".

`prometheus.url` defaults to **metalk8s-monitoring**'s `prometheus-operated` (not artesca-monitoring, whose Prometheus CR has `serviceMonitorSelector=null` and holds 0 GPU series — the DCGM ServiceMonitor is discovered by metalk8s-monitoring via the `metalk8s.scality.com/monitor: ""` label). `grafana.url` is derived per-instance from `OBJECTSTORE_ENDPOINT_IP` → `https://<ip>:8443/` (or explicit `GRAFANA_URL`); `grafana.password` comes from `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` (empty in-cluster; `dev-console.sh` auto-populates it laptop-side from the node's ARTESCA Keycloak admin secret). Grafana sits behind ARTESCA's `:8443` Keycloak SSO (realm `artesca`), so the login is the ARTESCA admin, **not** the Grafana local admin (its form is disabled).


## Box GPU mode — sharing the box with the AI Factory

A box can also run the AI Factory, whose GPU switch moves the whole box between `vss` and `llm` (VSS GPU workloads at 0, vLLM on the GPUs) and records the mode in ConfigMap `ai-factory/gpu-mode` — its only writer. The console is the front door and gets out of the switch's way. [`src/lib/box-mode.ts`](src/lib/box-mode.ts) is the one reader and the one guard; operator-facing behaviour is in the README ("Sharing the box with the AI Factory").

- **No record is `vss`, and so is an unreadable one.** 404 → `source: "absent"`; 403, timeout (3 s) or a record that does not parse → `source: "error"` with the cause in `reason`. Failing open is deliberate: failing closed would freeze every VSS box whose RBAC lacks the read. The read is cached 10 s, and the guard re-reads on every write, so nothing is sticky — writes resume once the mode is `vss`.
- **The owned set is derived from `CLUSTER`**, not hard-coded: `rtvi.vlmDeployment`, `vst.streamProcessingDeployment` (a StatefulSet on Helm), `kvcache.vllmDeployment`. Matching is namespace + name, not kind.
- **Two layers, both needed.** Routes check up front with `boxPausedResponse([...workloads])` and answer 409 before their first write — `restart/[component]`, `tuning/rtvi`, `tuning/vst`, `profiles/[name]` PUT — so a save cannot patch a ConfigMap and then be refused the restart that makes it take effect. Under them, `assertWorkloadWritable` throws `BoxPausedError` from `rolloutRestart`, `scaleDeployment`, the adapter's `patchDeploymentEnv`/`ensureDeploymentStrategy`, `applyPromptLive` and the rtvi env patch, so a writer added later is still refused. A guard on a workload the switch does not own returns without reading the record.
- **The reconcile pass reads the mode only when it has a guarded write to make** (refs present, or recording-recovery enabled), logs one `paused: box in <mode> mode …` line per cycle, skips the VLM strategy, defers the prompt (a drift note; `reconcilePrompt(…, { paused })` reads but never writes) and skips the whole recording-recovery pass — every recorder reads stalled when the switch has it at 0. Cameras and scenarios still converge.
- ⚠ **Unit tests must not reach the default reader.** It calls the real `coreV1()`, which off-cluster loads the laptop's kubeconfig — a test that runs a reconcile tick or a guarded route without mocking `@/lib/k8s` reads whatever cluster the current context points at. Inject with `resetBoxModeCache({ reader })`, or pass `boxMode` to `runReconcileAgentOnce`.
- The banner ([`BoxModeBanner.tsx`](src/components/BoxModeBanner.tsx), in `Shell`) polls `GET /api/box-mode`; `AI_FACTORY_URL` reaches the client through `BoxModeProvider` from the root layout, read at request time, so a ConfigMap change needs no rebuild.

## AWS and Helm

⚠ **The console holds no AWS credentials** and must not acquire any — how it reaches what it needs, and the VSS 3.2 Helm compatibility rules: [`docs/aws-and-helm.md`](docs/aws-and-helm.md).

## Data-fetching pattern

Server components import collectors from [`src/lib/overview-collector.ts`](src/lib/overview-collector.ts) directly — **no server-to-self HTTP, no Zod re-parse**. `collectOverviewSnapshot()` and `collectPodSummaries()` always resolve with a degraded snapshot + `warnings[]` rather than throwing, so a single broken probe doesn't take down the page.

The `/api/status/overview` and `/api/pods` routes are thin auth + JSON wrappers around the same collectors, used **only** by client components (`OverviewAutoRefresh`, the tuning page) where the HTTP + Zod boundary is appropriate.

This means: when adding a new server-rendered page, import the collector function directly. When adding a client component that needs live updates, hit the API route.

**Live streams (SSE).** Long-lived pushes (`/api/incidents/live`, `/api/pipeline/live`, `/api/camera-sim/journal`, kafka tails) go through [`src/lib/streams/sse.ts`](src/lib/streams/sse.ts)`::createSseResponse`, which emits an initial `: connected` comment the instant the stream opens. Next.js does not send a streamed response until its body's first chunk, so without that byte `EventSource` fires `open` only when the first real datum (or the 15s heartbeat) arrives — leaving the client on "reconnecting" for up to ~15s. The helper also owns the 15s heartbeat and abort teardown. `/api/incidents/live` additionally *polls* the alert-bridge (`GET /api/v1/realtime/incidents`, every 4s, per-poll timeout so a slow bridge can't stall the open) and pushes newly-seen incidents — it does **not** consume Kafka; the first poll primes the seen-set without replaying the backlog (the page's initial `GET` already rendered it).

Routes for `/cameras`, `/prompt`, and `/scenarios` read/write the config store via `makeReconcileContext()` + write-through `reconcile-core`. Kubernetes is the only runtime: the `CONSOLE_RUNTIME=docker` path (docker-socket container recreation, GCS-backed camera restore, the compose topology and overview collectors) was removed — `docker-sock.ts`, `gcs-bootstrap.ts`, `camera-restore-watcher.ts` and `caption-bridge.ts` with it.

**Chat + media + agent-config routes.** `POST /api/chat` proxies to the vss-agent's OpenAI-compatible `/chat` (`VSS_AGENT_URL`, default derived from `VSS_NAMESPACE` on the k8s path) and rewrites the agent's browser-unreachable media host (`CLUSTER.agent.mediaHost`, e.g. `vss-agent:8000`) to the same-origin `/api/media` proxy so clip/snapshot links in the reply resolve in the browser — gated by `CLUSTER.mediaProxyEnabled` (env `VSS_MEDIA_PROXY_ENABLED`). `GET /api/media/[...path]` is that proxy: it streams VST clip/snapshot bytes from `CLUSTER.vst.mediaOrigin`, restricted to a `Content-Type` allowlist keyed off the file extension, always serving `nosniff` + a `sandbox` CSP + `inline` disposition, with a path-traversal guard plus a post-normalization origin/prefix re-check pinning it to the `/vst/storage/` webroot. `GET`/`PATCH /api/agent-config` backs the `/agent` page — `GET` reads the live prompt / `max_iterations` / LLM wiring **and the active provider (`llmModelType`)** plus a live `{LLM_BASE_URL}/v1/models` reachability probe (`api.anthropic.com` is probed with `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version`; OpenRouter and NIM take a plain `Bearer`); `PATCH` accepts `llmModelType` (`nim`|`openai`), patches the `vss-agent-config` ConfigMap and/or the `vss-agent` Deployment env (JSON-patch env replace; wires `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the `vss-agent-anthropic` secret and strips `openai_llm.temperature` when the target serves Claude) and rolls a restart. **Known caveat:** the health probe reads the agent key from the plaintext `NVIDIA_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` env, so on the Claude path (where `OPENAI_API_KEY` is a `secretKeyRef`) it can't read the key and the badge shows a false `✕ auth failed` even though chat works — resolve the secretKeyRef in the probe to fix.

**TTS routes (on-box voice).** `POST /api/tts` proxies the on-box NVIDIA **Magpie TTS NIM** (`CLUSTER.tts.url`, env `VSS_TTS_URL`, default `http://magpie-tts.<vss-ns>:9000`) — builds a multipart `POST /v1/audio/synthesize` (`language`/`text`/`voice`) and streams back the `audio/wav`; fail-soft 502/503 so the client falls back to the browser voice. `GET /api/tts/voices` probes availability + lists voices (`parseVoiceList` in [`tts-voices.ts`](src/lib/tts-voices.ts) normalizes Magpie's `{"<langs>":{voices:[…]}}` shape); returns `{available:false}` when the NIM is down so the selector omits the on-box option. The NIM itself is deployed by [`k8s/nvidia-vss/tts/00-magpie-tts.yaml`](isv-labs:k8s/nvidia-vss/tts/00-magpie-tts.yaml) (GPU time-slice, model-cache PVC, `ngc-secret` pull; builds TensorRT engines on first start — validated on the Blackwell GPU). A third, NVIDIA-**hosted** engine (build.nvidia.com, NVCF gRPC `grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com` function-id `877104f7-e885-42b9-8de8-f6e4c6303969` + Bearer nvapi) is a planned addition.

## Persistence layers

**The config store has two backends and the default is a YAML file** — one per instance at `$CONSOLE_DATA_DIR/config-store/<instance>.yaml`. Firestore is the other, selected with `CONSOLE_CONFIG_STORE=firestore`, and its SDK is an **optional install** (`WITH_FIRESTORE=1`, mirroring the telemetry SDK) because a default clone would otherwise pull 208 packages for code paths it never reaches. Full design, semantics and the migration procedure: [`docs/console-config-store.md`](docs/console-config-store.md).

Three things from it that bite:

- ⚠ **Unset is not the same as `file`.** With `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID` set and `CONSOLE_CONFIG_STORE` unset, the console infers `firestore` — deliberately, because `kubectl set image` does not touch the ConfigMap and every pre-existing lab's data is in Firestore. A flat default would bring that pod up on an empty file with no error.
- ⚠ **Two pods write the store**, always: the console (UI edits, plus one startup convergence pass whatever `CONSOLE_DISABLE_RECONCILE_LOOP` says) and the `reconcile-agent` (status on every tick). So `CONSOLE_DATA_DIR` must be a volume both mount, and the file backend takes a cross-process lock — an in-process mutex would not reach.
- ⚠ **`upsert` replaces the whole entity, never merges fields.** The camera PATCH route unbinds a `promptId` and clears a `scenarioIds` override by `delete`ing the key and upserting; a merge makes both silent no-ops, and `scenarioIds` additionally loses its tri-state (absent = `sensor_filter` glob, `[]` = suppress all). One contract suite runs against both backends for this reason.

| What | k8s path | docker path |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| Sessions, profiles, audit log, incident reports (`incident_reports`) | SQLite on PVC `console-data` (5 Gi) | SQLite on PVC `console-data` (5 Gi) |
| Camera registrations | The config store (`cameras`); reconcile loop converges the in-cluster `register-cameras` Job from it. | ConfigMap `cameras` in ns `pyramid-ingress` + GCS canonical `cameras/<vss-instance>.json`; `camera-restore-watcher` keeps them in sync. |
| VLM system prompt | The config store (`promptSets` + `activePromptId`); reconcile loop converges ConfigMap `rtvi-runtime-env`. | ConfigMap `rtvi-runtime-env` (key `RTVI_VLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) + GCS canonical `prompt/<vss-instance>.json`. |
| Alert scenarios | The config store (`scenarios`); reconcile loop converges ConfigMap `scenarios`. | ConfigMap `scenarios` (key `scenarios.yaml`) + GCS canonical `scenarios/<vss-instance>.json`. |
| Per-camera overrides (`scenarioIds`, `recording`) | Fields on the config store's camera entry. | SQLite `camera_overrides` table on PVC `console-data`. |
| K8s secrets | `console-auth`, `console-ssh` (2 required before first apply) | `console-auth`, `console-ssh` (2 required before first apply) |

On the docker path, `bootstrap-compose-console.sh` auto-restores cameras + prompt + scenarios from GCS on every restart. Manual restore: `scripts/sync-cameras.sh --restore`, `scripts/sync-prompt.sh --restore`, `scripts/sync-scenarios.sh --restore` (each takes `--instance <name> --nvidia-vss-host <ip>`).


## Build, CI and deploy

The build pipeline, the E2E environment, who hears a red run, the smoke test and the deploy-and-validate step: [`docs/ci-and-deploy.md`](docs/ci-and-deploy.md). ⚠ The workflow cannot mail — this repo is absent from the `github-pool` WIF allowlist and has no Actions secrets — so a red or **unverified** `build-console` run is caught by a laptop LaunchAgent (`com.scality.console.ci-alert`) instead.

## Architecture sheets (ISV-ARCH-05, ISV-ARCH-06)

```bash
node scripts/diagrams/dump-model.mjs > model.json
node scripts/diagrams/build-console.mjs model.json ../isv-portal/presentations/diagrams/sheets/vss-console.excalidraw

node --conditions=react-server scripts/diagrams/dump-flow.mjs > flow.json
node scripts/diagrams/build-flow.mjs flow.json ../isv-portal/presentations/diagrams/sheets/vss-flow.excalidraw
```

**ISV-ARCH-06** follows one frame from the lens to the operator — the three paths it takes at once, the carrier at each boundary, and where each lands on ARTESCA. It **imports** [`cluster-refs.ts`](src/lib/cluster-refs.ts) rather than parsing it, since those values are computed from `process.env` with defaults and a regex would read the source of a name instead of the name. Two consequences: the dumper must run under `--conditions=react-server`, because `cluster-refs.ts` opens with `import "server-only"` whose default entry throws by design; and it emits an explicit allowlist rather than the `CLUSTER` object, which carries live credentials (`CLUSTER.grafana.password` among them) onto a sheet that gets published.

**ISV-ARCH-05** draws the operator surface.

Draws the operator surface: the 22 pages by what kiosk mode does to each, the config-store entities shared with the deployer, and what the 68 API routes reach. Everything on it is read from source at run time — pages from [`Nav.tsx`](src/components/Nav.tsx), kiosk state from [`lib/kiosk.ts`](src/lib/kiosk.ts), shared state from the `ConfigStore` contract, backend reach from a walk of each route's `@/lib` imports. The scene builder is shared with the other sheets and lives in `scality/isv-portal` under `presentations/diagrams/lib/` (clone it next to this repository); the generator stays here, because it can only read this repo's source from inside it.

⚠ **The import walk follows `await import()` as well as `from`.** The reconcile context is reached dynamically at all 16 of its call sites, so a static-only walk concludes that no route touches the config store — which is exactly backwards, since that path is how cameras, prompt and scenarios are written.

Two things the walk surfaced:

- **Every nav page is in exactly one kiosk list** (`tests/unit/kiosk.test.ts` pins it). [`proxy.ts`](src/proxy.ts) redirects a page in neither to `/`, even when a kiosk page links to it: the overview hero's storage tile (`/storage`) and chat's search thumbnails (`/search?q=`) did, until `/evidence` went to the hidden list (Seal writes WORM objects and its route has no `rejectIfKiosk`) and `/search`, `/analytics` and `/storage` to the allowed one. The `/kvcache` explainer's `/evidence` link still leads to `/` in kiosk mode.
- **Still open: seven mutating routes outlive their own page.** `proxy.ts` states that "mutating API routes are already guarded by `rejectIfKiosk()` in each handler", and 17 of 33 are. The other 16 include seven under a page kiosk hides — `/api/cameras/[id]` (PUT/PATCH/DELETE), `/api/cameras/[id]/restart`, the three `sync-gcs` routes and `/api/diagnostics/[test]`. `/api/cameras/[id]` DELETE is the sharpest: the sibling collection route `/api/cameras` POST *does* guard, so the asymmetry is within one resource. `/api/settings/kiosk` is exempt by design and named as such in the dumper — it is the exit from kiosk mode, and guarding it would trap the session.

## Issue tracking — GitHub, not Jira

**Work on this repository is tracked in its own GitHub Issues.** This repository is
published under Apache-2.0 and read by people with no Scality account, so a tracker
they cannot open is not a tracker: an `ISVD-…` key tells an outside reader that a
decision exists and denies them every word of it.

Three consequences, and the third is the one that gets forgotten:

- **File here, not in ISVD.** A bug, a feature, a limitation of the published
  console — GitHub. What stays in ISVD is work that is *about* Scality's own
  deployment rather than about the console: lab migrations, showroom demos, the
  publication programme itself (ISVD-547 and its children).
- **`ISVD-…` keys already in the tree stay.** 33 of them across 26 files, plus 62
  commit footers. They record which change a line came from, and that is worth
  more than a tidy tree. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) tells an outside reader
  what they are so they do not hunt for a dead link. New references use
  `Issue: #<number>`.
- **A Jira ticket that has a public counterpart says so, one way.** Put the GitHub
  URL in the ISVD ticket. Never the reverse, and never paste Jira content into a
  GitHub issue — internal tickets carry customer names, lab hostnames and
  credential-adjacent detail, and a public comment cannot be unpublished. This is
  also why no two-way sync connector is wired: the throughput it would buy on a
  repository with near-zero external issue volume does not pay for a leak that
  posts itself.

Security findings are the exception to all of it and go through the Security tab's
private advisory flow, never an issue — [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) states the
policy and the known limitations of a default deployment.

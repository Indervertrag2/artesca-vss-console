# ARTESCA VSS Console

Operator console for [NVIDIA VSS](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/video-search-and-summarization) running on Kubernetes with [Scality ARTESCA](https://www.scality.com/artesca/) as the object store. One pane for service health, camera registration, alert scenarios, VLM prompt and inference tuning, incident playback, and what the stack has written to S3.

It runs **inside** the cluster as a `Deployment` in namespace `console`, serving `:8800`. It assumes VSS is already deployed and reachable — **it does not install or provision anything**, and it is not a VSS component: it is a separate UI that reads and patches a running stack.

Design rationale and the operator-facing intent of each page: [`docs/console-design.md`](docs/console-design.md).

> **Do not expose this to an untrusted network.** Authentication is a single shared password, the Kubernetes RBAC it requests is broad, and some pages render credentials. Those are properties of the code as published, not oversights — [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) lists them in full and is worth reading before you copy this into a cluster.

## What it expects

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kubernetes | A cluster with VSS deployed. Namespace layout `vss-<profile>` (Helm) or the pre-Helm per-component layout via `CONSOLE_LEGACY_NAMESPACES=1`. |
| Object store | ARTESCA (or any S3-compatible endpoint) for recordings, evidence and KV-cache offload. |
| Node | 24 — what the image and CI both build with (`node:24.18.0-alpine`). |

Every namespace and service name the console addresses is resolved in [`src/lib/cluster-refs.ts`](src/lib/cluster-refs.ts) from `process.env` with a default; the defaults are the Scality lab's (`VSS_NAMESPACE`, `CAMERAS_NAMESPACE`, `PROMETHEUS_URL`, `ARTESCA_HD_PROXY_URL`, `KVCACHE_VLLM_URL` are the ones most likely to differ on another cluster). What is genuinely lab-only rather than renamable: the camera-sim control plane and its SSH paths (`CAMERA_SIM_HOST`, `/api/camera-sim/*`, the `phase-smoke-*` and `nvidia-smi` diagnostics, which run over SSH on that host), the GCS sync routes (`/api/*/sync-gcs`), and the Grafana derivation from `OBJECTSTORE_ENDPOINT_IP`, which assumes ARTESCA's `:8443` shell. Each degrades to "unconfigured" when its env is unset. A report that the console does not come up against a differently-named deployment is useful, not a duplicate of something obvious.

## Local dev

The app starts with nothing configured — missing `KAFKA_BROKERS`, `REDIS_URL` or `CAMERA_SIM_HOST` render as degraded or disconnected rather than crashing, so most of it can be worked on without a cluster.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # every variable is documented in that file
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5003
```

```bash
npm run lint                 # eslint src
npm test                     # vitest
npm run test:e2e             # playwright
npm run build                # next build — next.config.js sets output: "standalone"
npm start                    # serves :8800 from the standalone build
```

`npm run test:e2e` needs a built Monaco under `public/monaco/vs`; the `pretest:e2e` hook copies it. `postinstall` deliberately does not, because the Dockerfile installs with `--ignore-scripts`.

## Container

Build it yourself — this is the supported path for anyone outside Scality:

```bash
docker build -t artesca-vss-console:local .
docker run -p 8800:8800 \
  -e CONSOLE_PASSWORD=changeme \
  -e AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -e AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8800 \
  artesca-vss-console:local
```

CI also publishes `ghcr.io/scality/artesca-vss-console:latest` and `:sha-<short-sha>` on every push to `main`. That package is currently private, so building from source is the path that works for everyone.

## Deploying to a cluster

Manifests are in [`k8s/`](k8s/) as a kustomization: namespace, RBAC, env ConfigMap, the console `Deployment`, and two PVCs.

```bash
cp k8s/10-secrets.yaml.example k8s/console-secrets.yaml   # gitignored; fill it in
kubectl apply -f k8s/console-secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -k k8s/
```

Three things that kustomization will not do for you, and each stops the pod:

- **`images.newTag` points at the private GHCR package.** Override it with the image you built (`kustomize edit set image`, or a patch).
- **The Secrets must exist first.** `console-auth` carries `CONSOLE_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET` and `CAMSIM_PASS` (see "Camera-sim API credentials" below) — Auth.js reads `AUTH_SECRET`, and a Secret carrying only the `NEXTAUTH_`-prefixed spelling leaves the pod refusing every request while `src/instrumentation.ts` logs `missing env vars: AUTH_SECRET`. `console-ssh` carries the camera-sim PEM. Object-store credentials are **not** here — they come from the `objectstore-creds` Secret, remapped to `OBJECTSTORE_*` in `k8s/20-console.yaml`.
- **`30-test-footage.yaml` is not optional**, despite being a feature: `20-console.yaml` mounts the PVC it declares, and Kubernetes has no optional PVC volume, so the pod does not schedule without it.

The console also needs a `console-writer` Role and RoleBinding in each namespace it patches, since it reads pods and patches ConfigMaps outside its own namespace. `01-rbac.yaml` covers namespace `console`; grant the equivalent in each `vss-<profile>` namespace you point it at.

## Camera-sim API credentials

The camera-sim's mediamtx API (`:9997`) requires HTTP basic auth. The console sends user `camsim` (override with `MEDIAMTX_API_USER`) and the password in `CAMSIM_PASS`, read from the `console-auth` Secret through `envFrom`; it is never committed or logged. With `CAMSIM_PASS` unset, `/cameras` and the topology report "mediamtx API credentials missing" instead of an empty camera list; a 401/403 reports "rejected the camsim credentials".

- **Get the password.** The camera-sim VM generates it at first boot into `/opt/camera-sim/.env` (mode 0600). Read it over SSH: `sudo sed -n 's/^CAMSIM_PASS=//p' /opt/camera-sim/.env`. Put it in `k8s/10-secrets.yaml.example`'s `console-auth` copy and re-apply; restart the console pod, since `envFrom` is read at start.
- **Reachability.** On GCP the VM opens only `:8554` (anonymous RTSP read) to the world; `:9997`, `:8080` and `:22` accept only the admin range, which is Google's IAP range (`35.235.240.0/20`) by default. A console pod's egress IP is not in that range, so the API is unreachable from the cluster until the VM is launched with the box's egress address as its admin source. The other fix is a tunnel from the operator machine, which a pod cannot use.

## Sharing the box with the AI Factory

A box can also run the **AI Factory**, a separate app whose GPU switch moves the whole box between two profiles: `vss` (this console's world) and `llm` (the VSS GPU workloads scaled to 0, vLLM on the GPUs). The switch records the mode in ConfigMap `ai-factory/gpu-mode` (keys `mode`, `pinned`, `updatedAt`, …) and is that record's only writer. The console is the front door: it reads the record and gets out of the switch's way.

- **Reading the mode.** [`src/lib/box-mode.ts`](src/lib/box-mode.ts) reads the ConfigMap, cached for 10 s. No namespace or no ConfigMap — a box without the AI Factory — reads as `vss`, and the console behaves exactly as it does without the feature. A read that is forbidden, times out or does not parse also reads as `vss`, with the cause in `reason`. `GET /api/box-mode` returns `{ mode, pinned, updatedAt, source: "configmap" | "absent" | "error", reason }`.
- **Writes the console holds while the mode is not `vss`.** The switch scales three workloads: the VLM Deployment (`vss-rtvi-vlm`), the VST recorder (`vss-vios-streamprocessing`) and the KV-cache demo's vLLM (`kvcache-demo/vllm-lmcache`). The console does not restart, scale or patch them: `/api/restart/<one of them>`, `PATCH /api/tuning/rtvi`, `PATCH /api/tuning/vst` and `PUT /api/profiles/<name>` answer **409** before their first write, with the reason in `error`. The reconcile loop skips the VLM strategy and prompt and the recording-recovery pass, logging one `paused: box in llm mode …` line per cycle; cameras and scenarios still converge. A prompt saved on `/prompt` is stored and reaches the VLM on the first pass after the box is back in `vss`. A secret rotation still lands, and its restart of a parked workload is skipped with a warning. Reads are never paused, and nothing is sticky: writes resume on their own once the mode is `vss`.
- **What the operator sees.** A banner on every page — "VSS paused — the box is running the LLM (AI Factory)" — and, in kiosk mode, a full-screen notice; both link to the AI Factory UI. The sidebar carries an **AI Factory** link in every mode. The link target is `AI_FACTORY_URL` (default `http://localhost:4090`, the laptop end of the AI Factory's tunnel).
- **The switch saves and restores the config store.** Leaving `vss`, the switch saves `GET /api/config-store/export` (cameras, scenarios, prompt sets and the active prompt id, as the store holds them) in its own snapshot store. Entering `vss`, it sends that copy to `POST /api/config-store/restore`, which fills each list that is **empty** and keeps every list that holds anything, the check and the write under one hold of the file's lock ([`src/lib/config-store/fill.ts`](src/lib/config-store/fill.ts), `FileConfigStore.fillEmpty`); it answers `{ restored, kept, activePromptId }`. An edit made while the box was in another mode therefore always wins; only an emptied list comes back. Restore needs the file store (501 on Firestore) and refuses another instance's copy (400). Export answers 503, never empty lists, when the store cannot be read. Both routes take the session like every API route, so the switch reaches them only where `CONSOLE_DISABLE_AUTH=true`. Tests: [`tests/unit/config-store-restore.test.ts`](tests/unit/config-store-restore.test.ts).
- **RBAC.** The read is a `get` on `configmaps/gpu-mode` in `ai-factory`, which `console-reader`'s cluster-wide `configmaps` get already covers. Narrow that rule and the read 403s; the console then reads `vss` and stops pausing.

## Pages

23 pages — 22 in the nav, grouped as the sidebar groups them, plus `/cameras/bindings`. Below the groups the sidebar links out to the AI Factory UI, which is a separate app, not a page.

### Live

| Route | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `/` | Overview — two views (operator and presenter), cluster health, pod summary, active incidents |
| `/topology` | Single-frame path diagram (camera-sim → VST → RTVI VLM → Agent → S3) with per-component health from `/api/pods` |
| `/incidents` | Incident timeline, live over SSE; detail with clip playback. Kiosk mode (`?mode=kiosk`) hides the nav |
| `/cameras` | Camera registration — writes the `cameras` ConfigMap and the canonical copy in the config store |
| `/cameras/bindings` | Which scenarios each camera is bound to (not in the nav; reached from `/cameras`) |

### AI & Storage

| Route | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `/search` | Semantic search over the VLM caption archive; results are clip-thumbnail cards with playback |
| `/analytics` | "Ask the store" — plain-English questions over the incident archive |
| `/chat` | Conversational chat with the vss-agent |
| `/evidence` | Immutable evidence via ARTESCA S3 Object Lock (WORM) |
| `/storage` | Per-bucket object counts, bytes, 24 h written, and a stream of objects as they land |
| `/kvcache` | KV-cache offload telemetry — model, endpoint, bucket objects and bytes, warnings, live cost timings |

### Configure

| Route | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `/scenarios` | Alert-keyword scenarios and per-scenario cooldown |
| `/prompt` | VLM system prompt (Monaco) and model deployment-name swap |
| `/tuning` | VST recording, alerting and VLM inference knobs, split across ConfigMap and Deployment env; Save + Restart patches both and rolls the workloads (refused while the AI Factory has the box in another GPU mode) |
| `/agent` | Agent configuration (system prompt, model preset incl. provider) and its tool catalog |
| `/test-footage` | Replay a local video file through the real pipeline to test the prompt and scenarios on actual frames |
| `/profiles` | Operator-defined scenes — saved prompt + scenario + tuning bundles |

### System

| Route | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `/secrets` | Cluster secret status and rotation |
| `/logs` | Pod log tail across namespaces |
| `/diagnostics` | Cluster health probes, GPU utilisation, Kafka consumer lag, VST storage panel |
| `/sizing-studio` | Embedded sizing studio |
| `/settings` | Auth, secret rotation, app version |
| `/about` | Build info, the resolved service-endpoint table, and whether telemetry is compiled in and configured |

## Env vars

[`.env.example`](.env.example) documents 46 variables, each with what it does and what breaks without it — the ones you need to get the app up, point it at your own object store, and see its logs.

**It is not the full set.** `src/` reads **142**, of which 42 are documented here — so **100 are not** (the other 4 in this file are consumed by Auth.js and the AWS SDK rather than read directly; counted 2026-10-01). They are mostly service URLs, Kafka topic names and ConfigMap keys with working defaults derived from `VSS_NAMESPACE`, which is why nothing appears broken without them. When something is misbehaving and you suspect configuration, [`src/lib/cluster-refs.ts`](src/lib/cluster-refs.ts) resolves most of them in one place and `git grep 'process\.env\.' src/` is the authority. Closing that gap is [#6](https://github.com/scality/artesca-vss-console/issues/6); a patch that documents one coherent group of them is a good first contribution.

## Telemetry

Off by default and in two independent ways: the Sentry SDK is not installed unless you opt in (`npm run enable-telemetry`, or `--build-arg WITH_TELEMETRY=1`), and no DSN ships in this tree. A build made from this repository reports nowhere. See [`docs/console-sentry.md`](docs/console-sentry.md).
